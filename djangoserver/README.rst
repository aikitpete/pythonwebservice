**django-excel** is based on `pyexcel <https://github.com/chfw/pyexcel>`_ and makes
it easy to consume/produce information stored in excel files over HTTP protocol as
well as on file system. This library can turn the excel data into Pythonic a list of
lists, a list of records(dictionaries), dictionaries of lists. And vice versa. Hence
it lets you focus on data in Django web development, instead of file formats.

The idea originated from the problem of the illiteracy of excel file formats of
non-technical office workers: such as office assistant, human resource administrator.
There is nothing with the un-deniable fact that some people do not know the difference
among various excel formats. It becomes usability problem to those people when a web
service cannot parse the excel file that they saved using Microsoft Excel. Instead of
training those people about file formats, this library helps web developers to handle
most of the excel file formats by unifying the programming interface to most of the
excel readers and writers.

The highlighted features are:

#. turn uploaded excel file directly into Python data struture
#. pass Python data structures as an excel file download
#. provide data persistence as an excel file in server side
#. supports csv, tsv, csvz, tsvz by default and other formats are supported via the following plugins:
